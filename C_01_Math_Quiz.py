To begin, choose how many questions you would like and 
then choose any of the operations which will be set to your question:

 [addition, subtraction, multiplication, division]
 
You can type "everything" or "e" for a mix of all of these.
(you can also type the first letter of operations to choose them).
 
Press <xxx> to exit the quiz at anytime.

Your goal is to try to guess as many correct as possible,
This is to test your arithmetic math knowledge!

Good luck.
