To begin, choose how many questions you would like and

 [addition, subtraction, multiplication, division]
 
You can press <enter> for a mix of all of these. 
Press <xxx> to exit the quiz at anytime.

Your goal is to try to guess as many correct as possible,
This is to test your arithmetic math knowledge!

Good luck.
